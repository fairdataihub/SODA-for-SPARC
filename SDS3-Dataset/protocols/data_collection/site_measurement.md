# Site Measurement Protocol

## Purpose

This document describes the standardized procedures for taking measurements at specific anatomical sites.

## Equipment Required

- Calibrated measurement tools
- Recording software v3.2
- Site localization guides

## Site Measurement Procedure

1. Identify the anatomical site using reference landmarks
2. Position measurement equipment according to the site-specific guide
3. Take three consecutive measurements with a 30-second interval
4. Record all values and calculate the average
5. Document any difficulties or deviations from protocol

## Data Recording

- All measurements must be recorded in the standard format
- Include site ID, subject ID, and measurement conditions
- Save raw data files using the naming convention: [site-ID]_[measurement-type]_[date]

## Quality Assurance

- Equipment must be calibrated at the beginning of each session
- Standard reference measurements should be taken daily
- Any measurement deviating more than 10% from expected values should be repeated
