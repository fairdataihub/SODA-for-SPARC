## About

SODA (Software to Organize Data Automatically) for SPARC is a desktop software intended to facilitate the data organization and submission process for [SPARC](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) investigators and thus promote the [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). The idea for a computer software that assists researchers in curating and sharing their data originated during the SPARC Hackathon in December 2018, where it won the Public's Choice Award, before receiving support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for further development. SODA for SPARC is designed such that users can accomplish all the [requirements to submit a SPARC dataset](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EQPn1FmANpPsFt3CguU-JOQVMMlJsNXluQAK_gb2qVg/edit?usp=sharing) rapidly through a single interface. Moreover, requirements have been broken down into easy-to-perform steps and automation has been integrated to reduce users' effort to a bare minimum during each step, often to just a few clicks.

## Downloading SODA

SODA is distributed as an easy-to-install application for Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu. Follow the instructions provided in [our dedicated documentation](https://fairdataihub.org/sodaforsparc/docs/getting-started/Download-Soda) to download the version suitable for your operating system.

All our releases are also accessible in the [releases tab](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/releases/latest).

## Using SODA

Click on the image below and watch our video to quickly familiarize yourself with the user interface of SODA:

</a>
</p>

Please see our [suggested workflow for preparing and submitting your SPARC dataset](https://fairdataihub.org/sodaforsparc/docs/getting-started/Organize-and-submit-a-new-SPARC-dataset-with-SODA) rapidly and accurately with SODA.

Although we would highly encourage you to use SODA for the entire organization and submission process of your dataset, SODA is designed such that you are not bound to using the software for all of the steps: you can perform desired steps from SODA and others outside.

## Full Documentation

See the [documentation](https://fairdataihub.org/sodaforsparc/docs/getting-started/User-Interface) for our full documentation, including details about each features and how to use them as well as guidance for using and contributing to our source code.

## Issues and Feedback

To report any issues with the software, suggest improvements, or request a new feature, please open a new issue via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/issues). Provide adequate information (operating system, steps leading to error, screenshots) so we can help you efficiently. Alternatively, you could also use [our feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyUw2_NI1-2tlAr8oB5_JcJ_yjTB-zUDt9skfGjNU9qjITwg/viewform?ts=5e433bea). The feedback form is also accessible directly in the user interface of SODA.
