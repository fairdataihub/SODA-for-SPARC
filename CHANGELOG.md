## Bug fixes:

- In Organize datasets, when importing files/folders the loading screen's z-index was higher than the duplicate alert popup. The issue has been resolved by lowering the loading screen's z-index.
- When uploading a dataset "Preparing list of files to upload" would verify files from Pennsieve individually. For datasets with large files this would cause a long wait time during this step. Another method of verifying files was created to verify files by retrieving the information folder by folder, reducing wait time significantly.
- Manifest files generated in SODA include timestamps following the designated SPARC format.
- Prepare Metadata - Create manifest.xlsx: The manifest editor's 'Save' and 'Cancel' buttons now are always viewable without having to scroll to the bottom of the manifest file.

### Known Issues:

- When a user has a large amount of files the step "Creating folder structure" can take a good amount of time.

## v.9.0.1 - 2022-09-02

## Bug fixes:

- Fixed an issue that caused the Organize Dataset feature to break when switching from Free Form Mode to Guided Mode and back.

### Known Issues:

- There is a bug when switching to Guided Mode before uploading Dataset Metadata in Free Form mode and then switching back to Free Form Mode. This will be addressed in the next update
- There is a bug with removing dataset permissions using both SODA and Pennsieve. If you want to remove your own permission from a dataset, another user with either 'Manager' or 'Owner' permissions must remove you from the dataset. This is an issue with Pennsieve's backend system and will be updated soon.
- When uploading a dataset through Upload Local Dataset or Organize Dataset feature to Pennsieve the upload will sometimes freeze. When this occurs it is best to reset the upload and ensure the Pennsieve Agent has been stopped before attempting to upload again. It is also necessary to verify the integrity of uploaded files up to that point. This can be done by simply ensuring all files from folders that have been uploaded are included in the Pennsieve dataset.
- The Organize Datasets option to upload duplicate files to Pennsieve uploads some duplicates but does not upload all.
- When using the Create manifest.xlsx feature any custom columns added to a manifest file stored on Pennsieve will not be imported for editing.
- The Create manifest.xlsx feature will spawn an error while generating manifest files for a local dataset if there are hidden files in the dataset directory. SODA will not tell the user the cause is the presence of the hidden files.
- In the Organize Dataset feature, if a dataset is large enough and being uploaded to Pennsieve it will not pass the file and folder integrity check. This is a separate issue from those that were fixed as part of the bug fixes section outlined in v.8.0.1. Users should find more large datasets are uploadable to Pennsieve than in the previous release. Note as well this does not apply to the Upload Local Dataset feature, which has a very high upper bound for the amount of files that can be uploaded to Pennsieve as of the current release.

This is an issue with Pennsieve's backend system and will be updated soon.
- When uploading a dataset through Upload Local Dataset or Organize Dataset feature to Pennsieve the upload will sometimes freeze. When this occurs it is best to reset the upload and ensure the Pennsieve Agent has been stopped before attempting to upload again. It is also necessary to verify the integrity of uploaded files up to that point. This can be done by simply ensuring all files from folders that have been uploaded are included in the Pennsieve dataset.
- The Organize Datasets option to upload duplicate files to Pennsieve uploads some duplicates but does not upload all.
- When using the Create manifest.xlsx feature any custom columns added to a manifest file stored on Pennsieve will not be imported for editing.
- The Create manifest.xlsx feature will spawn an error while generating manifest files for a local dataset if there are hidden files in the dataset directory. SODA will not tell the user the cause is the presence of the hidden files.

- Unshare with the Curation team
  - If you have already shared your dataset with the Curation team, you can now remove it from this state with a click of just one button
- Unshare with the SPARC Consortium

  - If you have already shared your dataset with the SPARC consortium, you can now remove it from this state with a click of just one button

- Search dropdowns:
  - Multiple dropdowns throughout SODA are now searchable. These dropdowns include the dataset list, PI owner/user/team list, and SPARC award list.
- Updated account management
  - SODA now restricts you to have only one valid account at a time. This account has to be within the SPARC Consortium organization. If you have any Blackfynn API keys from an unsupported organization they will be removed and SODA will prompt you to regenerate a new key set that is within the SPARC Consortium organization.
- Adding Permissions for users
  - Within the dropdowns for selecting users within the SPARC organization, you will now see their email for better clarity.
- Added support for TIFF banner images
  - If you wanted your TIFF image to be the banner image of your dataset, you can now use SODA to automatically convert and set your banner image.
- Added support for in-app updating on macOS

### Bug fixes:

- When uploading a local dataset to an existing Blackfynn folder, the 'skip' folders option now correctly uploads files that were not meant to be skipped.
- Creating a new local folder as your dataset destination now renames the generated folder correctly if a duplicate folder has to be created.
- Squashed a bug where files uploaded to Blackfynn were sometimes not renamed.
- Create dataset_description.xlsx file: Fixed bug where a contributor's affiliations have a comma.
- Fixed a bug where when you would upload files to Blackfynn, it would create a duplicate and not replace your old files.
- Added support for files with more than one extension. This fixes a bug where the manifest file was providing the incorrect file type.

## v3.0.1 - 2020-12-15

### Feature additions:

- Full file organization interface with lower-level folder support (1)
- Revised User Interface for the Prepare dataset -> Organize dataset feature aiming to make it more user-friendly and the curation process easier to follow through (2)
- Added in-app updating for Windows and Linux (Ubuntu)

#### Further notes:

- Feature (1) further explained: Extended the previous interface such that users can create virtual subfolder structures within high-level SPARC folders and specify files to be included in each of them.
- Feature (2) further explained: Changed user interface for the Organize dataset feature such that there are fewer texts and more easy-to-follow steps. It now follows the question-by-question format that guides users through the curation steps. This change aims at creating better interactions between SODA and users, thus making the curation process quicker and easier.

### Major bug fixes:

- Updated Airtable SPARC's table name to reflect the change initiated by SPARC. Prior to the fix, SODA could not connect to the SPARC award data sheet, thus raising an error when users utilize the Prepare metadata feature.
