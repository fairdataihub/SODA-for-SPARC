# Change Log

All notable changes to SODA will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v.6.1.0 - TBD

## Feature additions:

- Step 4 in Prepare a Dataset. README.txt is now a mandatory metadata file in datasets.
- Layout of Prepare Metadata tab has been changed. Buttons are spread out more evenly and Manifest file button received an icon change.

## v.6.0.0 - 2022-05-17

### Feature additions:

- In Organize Dataset: Lazy loading is now a feature when viewing all imported items in a dataset. This will increase performance when rendering large datasets (over 500+ items).
- Importing a local dataset will now be handled on the python end to increase performance. A progress bar is also included to show details about import to user.
- In the Organize Datasets section importing files/folders will cause a toast to display on the bottom right to notify the user of a successful import.
- SODA for SPARC now uses onefile builds for all OS!
- SODA for SPARC uses .asar formatting for Mac and Linux builds!
- Added the "Unknown" option for the "Sex" field in the subjects file generator.

### Bug fixes:

- Fixed bug under Step 3 - Organize datasets when users click Next to get to subsequent steps, and when they go back to this step, they cannot navigate in and out the high-level folders anymore.
- Added a SweetAlert loading popup for when users move a large number of files/folders under Step 3 - Organize datasets.
- Fixed bug related to the false warning of "The dataset does not contain valid SPARC folders" due to wrongly saved local dataset paths.
- Fixed UI bug related to the manifest file generator where the live spreadsheet is auto-opened without being prompted to open.
- Fixed bug with illegally formatted metadata files being dropped in Step 4: Metadata files.
- Fixed UI bug where tooltips in the Prepare Metadata section receive a top and a right message on hover.
- Fixed bug in Organize Datasets Step 3 where dragging and dropping folders with non-allowed characters would prevent further navigation.
- Fixed bug in Organize Datasets where files and folders would not keep their white space values once inserted into the UI.
- Fixed issue with drag and dropping folders with non-allowed characters being replaced/removed

### Known Issues:

- There is a bug with removing dataset permissions using both SODA and Pennsieve. If you want to remove your own permission from a dataset, another user with either 'Manager' or 'Owner' permissions must remove you from the dataset. This is an issue with Pennsieve's backend system and will be updated soon.
- When uploading a dataset through Upload Local Dataset or Organize Dataset feature to Pennsieve the upload will sometimes freeze. When this occurs it is best to reset the upload and ensure the Pennsieve Agent has been stopped before attempting to upload again. It is also necessary to verify the integrity of uploaded files up to that point. This can be done by simply ensuring all files from folders that have been uploaded are included in the Pennsieve dataset.
- The Organize Datasets option to upload duplicate files to Pennsieve uploads some duplicates but does not upload all.
- When using the Create manifest.xlsx feature any custom columns added to a manifest file stored on Pennsieve will not be imported for editing.
- The Create manifest.xlsx feature will spawn an error while generating manifest files for a local dataset if there are hidden files in the dataset directory. SODA will not tell the user the cause is the presence of the hidden files.

  - With the transition from Blackfynn to Pennsieve complete, SODA now uses the Pennsieve platform as the backend of the app.
  - For the user, the changes should be integrated in with no downtime. All pre-existing functionality of Blackfynn is now supported within SODA. You will only need new API keys for using SODA as well as the Pennsieve agent.

### Bug fixes:

- When creating the manifest files for local review, SODA will now ignore deleted files and folders before creating the manifest file.
- When you rename a file with more than one extension, SODA will correctly identify the name portion of the file and allow you to rename your file accordingly.
- For long file names or files with long paths, the user interface will break the text to control text clipping boundaries.

  - When you organize a dataset, you can now generate your manifest files locally to verify their accuracy before you upload them to Blackfynn.
  - A preview step is added to the dataset organization process that gives users a preview of their dataset structure, generate options, and options to edit if applicable. The dataset structure at this step will be shown in a tree view for an easy and convenient file track.
- Unshare with the Curation team
  - If you have already shared your dataset with the Curation team, you can now remove it from this state with a click of just one button
- Unshare with the SPARC Consortium

If you have any Blackfynn API keys from an unsupported organization they will be removed and SODA will prompt you to regenerate a new key set that is within the SPARC Consortium organization.
- Adding Permissions for users
  - Within the dropdowns for selecting users within the SPARC organization, you will now see their email for better clarity.
- Added support for TIFF banner images
  - If you wanted your TIFF image to be the banner image of your dataset, you can now use SODA to automatically convert and set your banner image.
- Added support for in-app updating on macOS

### Bug fixes:

- When uploading a local dataset to an existing Blackfynn folder, the 'skip' folders option now correctly uploads files that were not meant to be skipped.
- Creating a new local folder as your dataset destination now renames the generated folder correctly if a duplicate folder has to be created.
- Squashed a bug where files uploaded to Blackfynn were sometimes not renamed.
- Create dataset_description.xlsx file: Fixed bug where a contributor's affiliations have a comma.

It now follows the question-by-question format that guides users through the curation steps. This change aims at creating better interactions between SODA and users, thus making the curation process quicker and easier.

### Major bug fixes:

- Updated Airtable SPARC's table name to reflect the change initiated by SPARC. Prior to the fix, SODA could not connect to the SPARC award data sheet, thus raising an error when users utilize the Prepare metadata feature.
