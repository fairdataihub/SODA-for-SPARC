/*
Purpose: The dataset validator categorizes its errors using the below categories. Keeping these as an enum 
         as they are referenced a lot in error parsing and translating code, 
         and limiting mistyping would be very beneficial. I doubt the category names themselves will change, 
         but if so our references will not. 
         plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose
