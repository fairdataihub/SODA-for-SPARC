This dataset contains in vivo calcium imaging, home cage analysis and knee joint histology data.

The data contained within this repository has been published : <<DOI here> and the protocols are also published on protocols.io. Please refer to them for details of the experiments carried out.

In vivo imaging:
The in vivo imaging data is all contained within a separate folder. Please refer to the READ ME.txt files within the folder for details of what each file contains.

Home cage analysis:
The home cage analysis folder contains .csv files that contains all processed data.
Each .csv file contains data from a batch of n=4 mice

For the Antigen induced arthritis data, pre .csv file  = pre antigen induced arthritis challenge, post .csv file = post antigen induced arthritis challenge

For the Partial medial meniscectomy model data the each .csv file contains data from one batch at a specific timepoint.

Knee joint histology data:
Each .czi file contains data from a slide that contains knee joint sections stained with Safranin O and Fast Green.
