  "releaseNotes": "v.7.0.1 - 2022-07-29\n\nBug fixes:\n\nFixed an issue where SODA will exit on startup if the Pennsieve Agent is installed but there is not a configuration file or .pennsieve folder.\n\nKnown Issues:\n\nThere is a bug with removing dataset permissions using both SODA and Pennsieve. If you want to remove your own permission from a dataset, another user with either 'Manager' or 'Owner' permissions must remove you from the dataset. This is an issue with Pennsieve's backend system and will be updated soon.\nWhen uploading a dataset through Upload Local Dataset or Organize Dataset feature to Pennsieve the upload will sometimes freeze. When this occurs it is best to reset the upload and ensure the Pennsieve Agent has been stopped before attempting to upload again. It is also necessary to verify the integrity of uploaded files up to that point. This can be done by simply ensuring all files from folders that have been uploaded are included in the Pennsieve dataset.\nThe Organize Datasets option to upload duplicate files to Pennsieve uploads some duplicates but does not upload all.\nWhen using the Create manifest.xlsx feature any custom columns added to a manifest file stored on Pennsieve will not be imported for editing.\nThe Create manifest.xlsx feature will spawn an error while generating manifest files for a local dataset if there are hidden files in the dataset directory. SODA will not tell the user the cause is the presence of the hidden files.",
