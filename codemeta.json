  "schema:releaseNotes": "## Bug Fixes:\n- Fixed an issue with the Pennsieve agent version check not being able to detect old versions of the Pennsieve agent (The agent found at https://github.com/Pennsieve/agent).\n- Fixed an issue in how SODA reads the config.ini file that made it so that if the account name 'SODA-Pennsieve' exists it is always used for authentication with Pennsieve even when a defualt_profile key exists in the config.\n- Fixed an issue in the manifest creation and banner image upload/edit features of the Advanced Features tab that made it so users without Pennsieve Agents were not directed to the Pennsieve Agent download page. Instead they were told 'the pennsieve agent is not running.'\n- It was possible for an upload to fail early in 'Prepare Datasets Step-by-Step' and 'Upload Dataset' such that the catch statement referenced a variable that was not yet defined. This has been fixed.",
